The programs hencode and hdecode huffman encode and huffman decode, respectively,
a given file.The hdecode program decodes the encoded file to give the original. 
Note: These functions must be used together. There is no guarantee hencode will 
work with a different hdecode program (or vice-versa). These programs use Unix
system calls, so they will not work on Windows. These programs also use long long
format so they will not work on a 32-bit machine. If you would like to use these
programs on a 32-bit machine, change the 'total' variable in hdecode.c to an 
unsigned long. The supported file size will shrink to 500 mB. These programs also 
assume Little-Endian format, used on x86 processors. If you want to use these 
programs on a Big-Endian machine, you will need to change the order in which the 
codes are written. 
These programs  should work on files that are smaller than 2^64 bits (That's about
2 billion gB so I hope your file is smaller than that) and each individual 
character must appear less than 2^32 times (about 4 billion occurences). These 
programs use O_LARGEFILE so if your system does not support that, remove the 
GNU_SOURCE flag in the Makefile.

For hencode:
	Usage is: hencode infile [outfile].
 	If no outfile is given, the output is stdout. Note an infile is needed.
For hdecode:
	Usage is: hdecode [(infile)|-] [outfile]. If infile is not
   		given, the - signals to use stdin and if outfile is not given, 
		the output is stdout.
